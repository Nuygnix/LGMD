 Hate speech is supposed to express some sort of prejudice like racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, etc. Bonus points for slurs.

 There have been past presidents speculated to be atheist/agnostic because of their refusal to state their religion (James Monroe and Ulysses S. Grant). Thomas Jefferson also called the Book of Revelation the ""raving's of a maniac"", though the common thought is that he was a Deist, just not affiliated with the church.

It is not enough to simply make concessions to fight them, we must strike at the core. The oppressed need to be empowered, or they will be trod upon for all eternity.	0	conversation

1997	3	 Always guess Kiwi, same as if you can't tell US vs Canada guess Canada. Aussies and Yanks don't care too much if you get it wrong, but Kiwis and Canadians are absolutely gobsmacked if you guess it correctly (because no one ever does)	0	conversation
1997	4	U2, this is true. I've never been to Canada, but I've lived here all my life and I'm on the ball enough to know when a Canadian is nearby. You Americans don't hear the subtle differences when two Yanks are talking.	0	conversation

1998	3	They already gave you an alien to fuck and they didn't take you for a science experiment or sacrifice you to an ancient God. Maybe don't try to fuck more aliens.	1	conversation

2000	1	"subreddit = Libertarian Title: Muh electricity! 
 How would a libertarian society/AnCap world provide utilities like electricity and water?"	0	conversation
2000	2	 Isn‚Äôt electricity already privatized, if not regulated? And water is also privatized in some cities. The difference would be to let go of the regulations. 	0	conversation
2000	3	 Yes and no, it so privatized but under many regulations. So technically not a libertarian or AnCap situation.	0	conversation
2000	4	Sure, but it would be a less onerous state, and that means we should prefer it over its alternatives. I prefer a less onerous state over no state.	0	conversation
